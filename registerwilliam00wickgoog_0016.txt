INTRODUCTION. V.

in Buckinghamshire, ΝΕ. of Tring, on the presentation of
the bishop of Winchester‚ vacant by the resignation of Master
Suicard, the last rector, an inquisition having been taken
thereon by M(atthew) de Stratton, the ε, archdeacon 01
Buckingham.1 The bishop of Winchester‚{who presented
Wickwane was John de Exonia or Οιιοιιιι,2 or Gemsey‚ who
before his consecration in 1262, had been chancellor of York.
Robert of Scarborough, afterwards dean of York, is said to
have been possessed of this dignity in 1262, and Wickwane
in 1263.³ The exact date of his appointment as chancellor
i uncertain, as the register of archbishop Godfrey de Ludham
(1258-1264) has not been preserved.4 He occurs as chancel-
lor in November, 1267.5 He does not appear to have
figured very prominently during the primacy of Archbishop
Giffard. He claimed the prebends of Newbald against
Cardinal Ancherus,⁶ and there is an undated letter⁷
from him to his diocesan, complaining in somewhat querulous
terms that he had been robbed of certain fees due to himas
chancellor.

On April 28, 1279, three days after the death of Arch-
bishop Giffard,⁸the king committed the custody of the see,
during the vacancy‚ to Thomas de Normanville and Master
Henry of Newark, who was afterwards archbishop.⁹ The
election took place on St. Alban's day (June 22),10 when
