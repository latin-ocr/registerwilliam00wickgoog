conveyances, with the local dean and his clerk, he came to
hold the chapters ol the rural deaneries with a superfluity of
eonveyanceS, bringing with him a friend, the rura] dean and
his clerk, the archbishop’s sequestrator, and an apparitor,
so that the clergy were oppressed like the children of Israel
under Pharaoh. Another example of his care for his clergy
appears by his refusal to accept the subsidy to be paid to him
by his clergy, except from those who would pay willingly

He had other quarrels besides those mentioned above..
The prior and convent of Carlisle‚ whom he had believed to
be friendly to him, got him excommunicated (No. 699)1,
and in some way, not explained, he got into hot water with
the collectors of the Tenth for the relief of the Holy Land,
and was obliged to make a very humble apology‚ which he

St. Mary’5‚ York, Nostell, Warter, and Whitby, all was
well (p. 137n). At Selby (No. 75), Thomas of Whalley, the
abbot appointed by Archbishop Giffard in 1270‚³wasafailure.
He wasted the property of the house, was immoral, violent,
and resorted to a wizard for help to find the body ol his
brother who had been drowned in the Ouse (No. 75)· As
