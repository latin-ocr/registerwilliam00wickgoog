INTRODUCTION.

Oi the life oi William Wickwane, who succeeded Walter
Giffard as archbishop of York in 1279, very little is known
prior to his elevation to that dignity. His name is spelt
Wygwane (No. 673), Wykkewane (Annales M onustici (Rolls
Series), iii.‚ 281, iv.‚ 305), Wykewane or Wikewane (Ι bid, iii.‚
323), and Giffard's Register, 134), Wickwane (leid, iii.‚ 392),
Wykwan (Chronicoa de Laaercost, 120), and Wykewan
(Historiam ο) the Church ο) York aad its Archbishops (Rolls
Series), ii., 407), and Wychewang (Chronicon Walteri de

Hemingburgh, ii., 7). Like Thomas of Adderbury and -

Adam oi Bibury he was one of archbishop Giflard’s importa-
tions from the West Midlands into the diocese of York. The
place from which he derived his name is now called Child’s
Wickham, a small parish in Gloucestershire, close to the
borders oi Worcestershire, a mile west of Broadway‚ about
five miles south of Evesham, and the same distance west of
Chipping Campden. In Domesday (edition 1793, io. 168,
col. 2) it appears as Wicvene; in the Rutuli H undredorum
(1., 170, 172) as Wykewane and Wykewan3 in the Testa de
Neuill (p. 80, 82), as Wykewanne, and in Pope Nicholas's
Taxation (p. 223) as Wykewan. 4Α friend, who lately
visited Child’s Wickham, writes: -“As to Child’s Wickham,
it lies about half a mile to the left oi the road from Moreton-
in·the-Marsh to Evesham. The turning is 'about a mile
south-west oi Broadway‚ and tour miles from Evesham.
The village is small, and stands on absolutely flat ground in
the vale of Evesham; but, east of it, the Cotswolds rise to
their highest point above Broadway. There is a good vicar·
age, but Ι could see no other house oi any importance. The
nave of the church has been rebuilt. A rather plain and early
Norman west door remains, in iront of which the tower, of
late 14th or early 15th century work, has been built.
There is a handsome spire ; but the tower, like that of the
neighbouring church of Church Honeyboume, or Leck·
hampton, near Cheltenham, is very plain, with hardly any
wirrdows. The nave has no aisles ; near its east end, a very
simple Norman arch, without mouldings, and springing irom
impost blocks, leads into a northern transeptal chapel, in
