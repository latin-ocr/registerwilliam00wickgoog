as plurality and orders, formed part of the inquiries always

made at visitations (No. 382). Where possible, the presentee
was compelled to resign any other living (Nos 80, 187, 322,
348), unless he could shew a dispensation allowing him to
retain it (No. 213). From two commissions to inquire into
the subject ot plurality (Nos. 316, 639), it would appear that
many dispensations pennitting non-residence were issued
by the pope. A striking instance of Wickwane's determina-
tion to prevent improper persons being thrust into his
diocese is afforded by N0. 629, where he tells Lewis oi Savoy
that in spite of the application of the king, whose relation
he was, he would not allow him to exchange the prebend
he held in York Minster for another in a more convenient
place. Against Wickwane’s action with regard to Lewis of
Savoy may fairly be placed his obsequious conduct on
behalf oi Napoleone (No. 464), probably a member oi the
Orsini. Nicholas ΙΙΙ. was a member of the same family, so
that the comphment to Napoleone was directly addressed to
the pope. Giordano, through whom it was transmitted,
was one ot the Orsini cardinals who were imprisoned by the
people of Viterbo in the conclave of 1281. (Gregorovius
Gesch. Stadt Rom, Eng. Trans, v. p. 492).

There is little doubt that the form of inquisition, taken on
the vacancy of a living (No. 555), was the same as in the
time of Archbishop Giffard, in whose register there are many
examples, but there is only one specimen in this register,
that taken on the occasion oi the vacancy of Weston in
Nottinghamshire (N0. 217). Criminous clerks were another
source oi trouble. As many persons took minor orders
with the object of protecting themselves under the privileges
thereby conferred, criminous clerks wer'e not uncommon.
One of these privileges was that persons in holy orders could
only be tried in ecclesiastica] courts, so when the 'justices
itinerant came to try crimina] cases, commissaries from the
ordinary appeared to claim any clerics who might be put on
their trial (Nos. 42, 200). Two conversi oi Rufiord Abbey
were delivered by such commissaries from secular judges
and handed over to the ecclesiastical jurisdiction (No. 234).
The archbishop was keenly alive to the danger of persons
leading a scandalous and vagabond life under the shelter ot
this privilege, and thus bringing discredit on the clerical
character. To obviate this danger he ordained that, unless
these clerks should attend school, they were not to look to
