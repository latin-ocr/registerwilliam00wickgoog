P. 318, l. 19. erin, in the diocese oi Hereiord, is prob
ably Worthen, Cherbury Hundred, Salop, and in the old
deanery of Pontesbury, Ludlow archdeaconry, S. W. of
Shrewsbury. It is not far south of Alberbury (so spelt in
Pope Nicholas’s Taxation), and is now in Montgomery·
deanery. A possible alternative is Eardisland‚ Stretford
Hundred, in Herefordshire, and Leominster deanery, Here-
ford archdeaconry. This takes the form Erleslen’ in Pope
Nicholas’s Taxation, and becomes Erislonde in the Valor
Ecclesiasticus, The name was evidently only known orally
to Wickwane and his registrary.

P. 339, side note. Blidworth is‘between Southwell and
Mansfield, not far from Newstead Abbey, which is in the
parish of Blidworth. The land between Blidworth and
Rufford is still forest-land, and there is a regular crop of
Robin Hood legends which have their centre at Blidworth.
The hundreds of Broxtow, Thurgart0n‚ and Calverton, are
all in the neighbourhood of Blidworth. Rayngwath, now
Rainworth, is 1} miles east of Blidworth.

P. 341 No. 933. Byssemede, now Bushmead, near St.
N eots (Hunts.)‚ but itself over the Bediordshire border, was
a prior of Black Canons. The site of the house oi the
Preaching Friars at Cambridge is occupied by Emmanuel
Colle e.

P. g343, col. 2. April 28, May 1, 1280. Hohn is probably
Hohne-on-Spalding Moor, near Market Weight0n‚ aud
Neusum, Newshohne, in the parish of Wressle, two miles
N. W. oi Howden.

P. 345. May19‚ 1281. This was Monday before Ascen-
sion Day, and had been appointed by the archbishop (No.
383) ior his visitation of Coupland deanery at Waberthwaite
aud. Muncaster. It looks as if this could have been held
more conveniently between the 3rd and the 10th; but it would
, have been quite possible ior him to have left Hornby on the
17th or 18th‚ have got through his visitation early on the
Monday, and returned to Homby along Morecambe Bay in
the astemoon and evening. It would have been a longish
journey3 but, tide allowing for the passage of the Duddon
or the Kent‚ quite possible on a long May day. May not

the length of daylight also allow for Grenton (June 19)
being Grinton in Swaledale?
