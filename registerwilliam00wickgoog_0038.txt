claimed by Master Robert oi Scarborough, dragged on
(Nos. 593, 627). Besides his canonry oi York (No. 2), he
obtained possession of the church of Settrington, on the ‘⁴

presentation of Roger Bigod‚ earl of Norfolk, though witha
proviso he should be ordained pn'est within a year (No. 372).
He long remained an annoyance and a source oi trouble in
the diocese, and No. 718 gives a recital oi his misdeeds in
the church of York, apparently as treasurer‚1 at a later
period. Richard de Vescy was another scandalous parson
whom the archbishop endeavoured to eject from his living.
Vescy had been presented to North Ferriby by Lady Agnes
de Vescy in 12721, but for some reason he fell under Wick-
wane's censure and was excommunicated (No. 320). Master
William of Cliff had been admitted in his place (No. 328),
but his entry was forcibly resisted by Vescy and his accom- .
plices, including his son Reginald (No. 329). He did not
hesitate to fortify the church, and displayed great violence in
expelling the lawiul rector (No 654). Ultimately some

Vescy was indueed to resign Ferriby by a promise of Escrick‚
of which he obtained possession in July, 1282 (No. 411).
He had already been instituted rector of Escrick under a
dispensation ior illegitimacy (No. 186), but the living had
been sequestrated and he excommunicated (No. 393), and
the church declared vacant (No. 730). From this last
document it appears he also passed under the name of
Kesham. =

The items in the accounts near the end of the volume give
some small insight into the arehbishop's character, and shew
him in a milder aspect. He had sporting tastes and got his
dogs couchers, setters, from Nonnandy (No. 652). When
he got them he made provisions both ior them and their
keeper (Nos. 660, 791). His wine came through Hull (No.
779), and ,was purchased from Hamund Box,³ a great
merchant there andin London (No. 823). He spent con·
