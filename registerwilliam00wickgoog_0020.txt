these remonstrances‚ and notwithstanding an appeal from
the king on behalf oi the prior and convent,2 proceeded
northward to hold the visitation. He reached Sherbum,
near Durham, on June 24, when he ordered Barnby to be
instituted,³ and thus did away with one of the causes of
appeal. On his entry into the city he was courteously met
by the prior, who took him to his house, where he was
entertainedinavery splendid manner and received handsome
presents, with the object, however, oi inducing him to refrain
from his visitation.4 The archbishop could not be persuaded
to forego any ot his rights, but endeavoured to get into the
churchyard with the idea oi entering the cathedral by the
north door. He was, however, driven back by a crowd oi
knights from different parts oi the bishopric. The arch·
bishop was in no wise daunted‚ but, standing in the open
space in tront oi the cathedral, now known as the Palace
Green, clothed in his canonicals, atter a weighty address to
the bystanders, he fulminated a solemn excommunication
against the bishop, prior, and chapter, and all others impeding
his visitation.⁵ The excommunication seems to have had
no effect, and been a mere brutum fulmen. Divers law

sentence of excommunication was revoked by the prior oi
Bamwell‚ thearchdeacon of Northampton, and the chamber-

Durham. This time, in consequence of the vacancy ot the
see, the opposition was led by the prior and convent. On
