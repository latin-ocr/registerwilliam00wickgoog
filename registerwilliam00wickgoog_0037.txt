Cases 01 immorality, whether by clerks (Nos. 216, 310,
402) 01 laymen, were sternly punished. Penances, not mere
money fines (Nos. 201, 203), were required 01 the penitents.

widow 01 John 01 Danthorpe‚ whom she was accused 01
having poisoned,2 were forced to submit themselves to
ecclesiastical censure 101 supposed immorality (Nos. 312,
