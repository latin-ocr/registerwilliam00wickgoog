X. INTRODUCTION.

the arrival oi the archbishop on July 3 he was not allowed
to enter the cathedral, but had to go to St. Nicholas Church,
where he proposed to excommunicate the prior and chief
men in the chapter. This so irritated certain young men in
the town that they cut off one oi the ears oi his horse, and,
but ior the intervention oi Wiscard de Charton and Peter de
Thoresby would, as was believed, have killed him. He was
glad to escape by a secret way down some steps to the
schools and along the Wear to Kepier.l

This second, affray much exasperated the archbishop
against the see of Durham, just at a time when his services
were very necessary. Anthony Bek, who had been arch-
deacon of Durham and canon of Ripon and Southwell, as
well as mediator between Wickwane and bishop Insula, was
elected bishop oi Durham on July 9, 1281,2 and had the
temporalities restored to him on Sept. 4³ The difficulty
was to persuade the archbishop to consecrate his new
suffragan. With the object oi conciliating him, Bek, who
was a very wealthy man, undertook to pay all the expenses
connected with the translationes the remains of St. William
from the. mean position they had occupied in York Minster
to a shrine worthy of them.4 This generosity on Bek’s part
to the mother church of the province, coupled with the
pressing solicitation oi the king, overcame the archbishop’s
reluctance. The translation and consecration took place

on the same day, the fifth of the ides of January (Jan. 9),
1283-4, in York Minster, in the presence oi the king and
queen and many of the chief men oi the country.⁵ Although
the archbishop had been prevailed upon to consecrate Bek,
histeelings against the prior and convent oi Durham remained
as bitter as ever. On the day iollowing Bek’s consecration
