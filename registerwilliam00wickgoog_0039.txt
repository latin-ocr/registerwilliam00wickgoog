siderable sums on plate and jeweIS, 20 marks for a couple of

pitchers (N0. 837), and as much as 74li 7s 4d at one time on ‘

jewels (No. 878). St. Ives in Huntingdonshire and Boston
were the two fairs at which purchases were made. Wick-
wane conferred one great benefit on the see of York by the
gift of a large head of stock‚ 602 oxen, 54 horses, and 1,000
sheep, to be kept on the lands of the see, with a proviso that
it should be handed on intact by each succeeding archbishop
(No 719)·

’ Full as this registetis compared with that ofArchbishop ,
Giffard, it by no means records all his activity. Stubbs¹
tells us that Wickwane devoted especial care to see that all
the churches in his diocese were duly dedicated. The
dedication of only two churches, Loweswater and Lancaster
(Nos. 386, 391), both situated in the archdeaconry of Rich-
mond, is mentioned, although there must have been many
undedicated churches, as one of the questions at visitations
was whether there were any such churches in the arch-
deaconry (No. 382). From other sources² we know that
Wickwane dedicated the parish church of Sheffield about
1286, and the abbey church of St. Mary, York, and the
parish church of Gilling-in-Ryedale in 1283, but of this
nothing is said in the register.

The archbishop as early as the winter of 1282 was hoping
to go to Rome, but was prevented by business (No. 922).
As time went on this desire grew stronger. No doubt the
labours and worries of his office, and the dispute with'
Durham, told upon him, although in some few cases he
was able to ease himself by the employment of Scotch
bishops³ to perform some of his duties In the summer ol
1284 he was able to make arrangements lor leaving England.
On May 31 in that year he had letters of protection from the
king to last three years,4 and on June 25 he nominated
Master Robert of Tadcaster and Hugh of Staplelord as his
attomeys to represent him whilst abroad.⁵ The exact date
