Newburgh, Healaugh Park, and Cartmel (Nos. 184, 427,
440), was a waming against the presence of women in the
house necessary, a special exception being made at Newburgh
in favour of the patron’s wife, who was to be allowed to stay
one night. The corrections made by the archbishop after
the visitations are most oi thern aiter the same pattem‚ and
are very practical. Take as an example the visitation of
Bolton Priory, which is the longest (No. 428). After an
exhortation to love and good behaviour the archbishop
proceeds to give directions ior the proper management oi
the monastic estates. Here, as in nearly every other case,
he attempts to prevent the growth of private property, by
ordering the locks on the carols and chests to be broken
open. Then follow rules for good behaviour‚ such as not
going outside, contessing not eating or drinking aiter
eompline or other improper times, ior silence, and repair of
ruinous buildings. At Newburgh and Bridlington (Nos.
184, 302) it was necessary to reprove the sporting tastes of
the canons, whilst at Kirkham and Bolton (Nos. 303, 428)
divine service, especially the chanting, was badly conducted.
Great attention seems to have been bestowed on the music,
aswe findaprior of Warter providingafund for the purchase
oi spices to be given as a reward ior improvement by the

canons of his house in singing the psalms. He laid great ,

stress 0n long pauses being made in the middle ot each
verse.1 Many ot the houses suffered from poverty. At
Bridlington (N0. 317) the dorter and offices were so small
the archbishop forbade the reception of any more inmates
till aiter his visitation. At Bolton (No 428) the church,
chapter-house, and buildings were on the point of falling
down, and at Healaugh Park (No. 520) the house was so
poor that the archbishop besought his official to make his
charges for confirming the election of the new prior as light
as possible. In the case of the smaller houses‚ such as
Hampole, Yedingham, and Moxby (Nos. 164, 188, 443), to
save expense, the visitation or care of the monastery
was not exercised by the archbishop in person, but by a
deputy.
