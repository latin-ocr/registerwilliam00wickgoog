(Nos. 593, 627). Besides his canonry of York (No. 2), he .
obtained possession oi the church oi Settrington, on the '

presentation of Roger Bigod, earl of Norfolk‚ though with a
proviso he should be ordained priest within a year (No. 372).
He long remained an annoyance and a source of trouble in
the diocese, and No. 718 gives a recital of his misdeeds in
the church of York, apparently as treasurer‚¹ at a later
period. Richard de Vesey was another scandalous parson
whom the archbishop endeavoured to eject from his living.
Vescy had been presented to North Ferriby by Lady Agnes
de Vesey in 12721, but ior some reason he fell under Wick-
wane's censure and was excommunicated (Νο. 320). Master
William of Cliff had been admitted in his place (No. 328),
but his entry was forcibly resisted by Vesey and his accom- .
plices, including his son Reginald (No 329). He did not
hesitate to fortify the church, and displayed great violence in
expelling the lawful rector (No. 654). Ultimately some

de Vesey in the spring ot 1282 (Nos. 364, 367). Probably
Vescy was induced to resign Ferriby by a promise of Escrick‚
oi which he obtained possession in July‚ 1282 (No. 411).
He had already been instituted rector of Escrick under a
dispensation for illegitimacy (No. 186), but the living had
been sequestrated and he excommunicated (Νο. 393), and
the church declared vacant (No, 730). From this last
document it appears he also passed under the name of
Kesham.

The items in the accounts near the end of the volume give
some small ins'ight into the archbishop‘s character, and shew
him in a milder aspect. He had sporting tastes and got his
dogs, couchers, setters, from Normandy (No. 652). When
he got them he made provisions both for them and their
keeper (Nos 660, 791). His wine came through Hull (No.
779), and ,was purchased from Hamund Box,3 a great
merchant there and in London (No. 823). He spent con-
