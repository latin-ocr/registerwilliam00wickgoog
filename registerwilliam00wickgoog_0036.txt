as plurality and orders, formed part of the inquiries always

made at visitations (No. 382). Where possible, the presentce
was compelled to resign any other living (Nos 80, 187, 322,
348), unless he could shew a dispensation allowing him to
retain it (No. 213). From two commissions to inquire into
the subject of plurality (Nos. 316, 639), it would appear that
many dispensations permitting non-residence were issued
by the pope. A striking instance of Wickwane's determina-
tion to prevent improper persons being thrust into his
diocese is afforded by N0. 629, where he tells Lewis of Savoy
that in spite of the application of the king, whose relation
he waS, he would not allow him to exchange the prebend
he held in York Minster for another in a more convenient
place. Against Wickwane’s action with regard to Lewis of
Savoy may fairly be placed his obsequious conduct on
behalf of Napoleone (No. 464), probably a member of the
Orsini. Nicholas ΙΙΙ. was a member of the same family, so
that the compliment to Napoleone was directly addresscd to
the pope. Giordano, through whom it was transmitted,
was one of the Orsini cardinals who were imprisoncd by the
people of Viterbo in the conclave of 1281. (Gregorovius
Gesch. Stadt Rom, Eng. Trans, v. p. 492).

There is little doubt that the form of inquisition, taken on
the vacancy of a living (No. 555), was the same as in the
time of Archbishop Giffard, in whose register there are many
examples, but there is only one specimen in this register,
that taken on the occasion of the vacancy of Wcston in
Nottinghamshire (No. 217). Criminous clerks were another
source of trouble. As many persons took minor orders
with the object of protecting themselves under the privileges
thereby conferred‚ criminous clerks wer'e not uncommon.
One of these privileges was that persons in holy orders could
only be tried in ecclesiastical courts, so when the justices
itinerant came to try criminal cases, commissaries from the
ordinary appeared to claim any clerics who might be put on
their trial (Nos. 42, 200). Two conversi of Rufford Abbey
were delivered by such commissaries from secular judgcs
and handed over to the ecclesiastical jurisdiction (No. 234).
The archbishop was kecnly alive to the danger of persons
leading a scandalous and vagabond life under the shelter of
this privilege, and thus bringing discredit on the clerical
character. To obviate this danger he ordained that, unless
these clerks should attend school, they were not to look to
