The new archbishop was in every respect a great contrast
1ο his predecessor.l Giflard had been a man of stately
presence, and a lover oi company and good cheer, and yet
chaste as well, though rendered somewhat weak and fretful
. by excessive corpulence. Wickwane was the very opposite,
meagre‚ austere, and hugal, yet, as the Lanercost chronicler
somewhat grudgingly admits, as far as could be seen from
outward appearance, a holy man and one with a very tendet
conscience.

His stern, unbending nature, which led him to insist upon
his rights to their fullest extent, caused him many troubles
Besides the dispute with Canterbury there was another with
his suffragan, the powerful bishop of Durham, which was
rendered more acute by his unwise conduct. The bishops of
Durhamhad always resisted, or at least evaded‚ visitations 1
by their metropolitan at York. Archbishop Giflard by the
exercise of a good deal ol tact, had been able to make a
visitation oi the prior and chapter of Durham, but only in a
very qualified way.2 This method of procedure did not
satisfy Wickwane. When he had been in office rather wmore
than a year, he gave notice that he intended to hold a
metropolitica] visitation of the diocese of Durham on the ·
morrow of St. John the Baptist’s day (June 25), 1281.³
Appeals were at once made against the intended visitation by
the bishop on the ground of partiality‚ as suits were depend-
ing between him and the archbishop, and on the further
grounds that none of his predecessors had ever exercised
such right of visitation, and that before doing so he must,
according to a constitution oi Innocent IV., first visit his
own chapter at York which he had neglected to do. The
grounds of appeal by the prior and convent ol Durham were
very similar. They alleged in addition, as shewing prejudice‚
the refusal of the archbishop to institute Master Adam of
Bamby, their nominee, to the living of West Rounton, and
his encroachments upon their jurisdiction in Howdenshire
