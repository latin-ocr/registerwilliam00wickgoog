Marton Priory, a small house of Austin Canons in the
forest of GaltreS, affords an example ·of how temporal
calamities brought about spiritual degradation. Here the
refonnation of the house was entrusted to the prior of
Newburgh, another house of the same order, who was
requested to send three of the inmates of his house to Marton
who by their good manner of life should restore its fallen
fortunes (No. 444). One of the canons at Marton was so
violent and unbearable, it being impossible to find locks of
sufficient strength to bind him, that the General Chapter
of the Order was commanded to send him to a place of sate
custody (No. 445).

The unsatisfactory condition of his elergy caused the
arehbishop a great deal of anxiety. Very soon after his
arrival in his diocese he issued a mandate (No. 61), requiring
all the rectors and vicars in his diocese, and others having
cures of souls, to be ordained to such orders as their cure
required. This seems to have been only imperfectly obeyed.
If the institutions for the first year of his pontificate in the
important archdeaconries of York and Nottingham are
tabulated, it will be found that in the former there were one
subdeaoon, 5 deacons‚ 3 priests, and one unspecified, and in
the latter4subdeacons,zdeaoons‚4priestS, and4unspecified.
Wickwane certainly strove to improve the condition of
affairs. At Hemsworth (No. 60), he required the presentee
to be ordained a priest, and removed the parson at Rampton
(No. 212) for not having become one. Even in the case of
aman of such importanoe as Baldwin Wake (No. 314), he
refused to institute his presentee to Scrayingham as he had
not been ordained a priest. Examples of the presentation
of elergyinminor orders by religious persons are not wanting.
The archbishop himself collated both a subdeaoon and a
deacon (Nos. 345, 361), and a deacon was provided by the
pope (No. 420). It was in consequence of the ignorance and
youth of so many of the presentees to livings that so many
licences for study had to be granted. These weresonumerous
that there are special sections, entitled “ Licencia '’ (see
pp. 38, 84, 115, 129). The licencee had the option of study·
ing in England or abroad, “ citra mare vel ultra ” (No. 39),
but in one case (No. 204) Paris is specifically mentioned as
the place of study.

Non-residence was another question which early engaged
the archbishop's attention (No. 496). This matter, as well
