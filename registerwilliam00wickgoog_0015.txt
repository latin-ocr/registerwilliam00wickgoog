the north wall 01 which is a narrow two-light window with a
cusped circle in the head, certainly contemporary with
Archbishop Wickwane and the Abbot 01 Winchcombe.
The chancel has also been rebuilt; but there are dwarf
columns about 5 feet high, in its eastern angleS, from which
a string-course runs westward along the north and south
walls, and finishes in the abaci 01 two similar columns, one
on each side. These seem to be old, c. 1190-1000 ; but the
light was very bad. The arrangement is curious, and
reminds me 01 the arrangement in the chancel at Hilton,
near Yarm. There is only one monument, a small 17th
century tablet high up on the wall 01 the transeptal chapel.
The inscription was quite invisible from below, and there

was no ladder about. At Broadway Ι saw a monument to
one 01 the Phillippses 01 Middle Hill‚ who were lords 01 the

⁴ - manor 01 Child’s Wickharn early in roth century.’'

The Wickwane family seem to have been connected with
the Abbey 01 Winchcombe. Walter de Wykwan, possibly
a brother 01 the archbishop, was 0011010101 that house, and
abbot (1282-1314). John de Wykwan, rector 01 Bledington,
near Stow-on·the-Wold, acted as proctor 101 the abbey, and
Master Jordan de Wicwane appears 00 witness to a deed
about burial at Hayles and to another deed relating to
Twining in Lower Kiftsgate Hundred.1 Only one relative
01 the archbishop is mentioned in this register‚ a brother,
Robert 01 Exeter to whom in January, 1282, the archbishop
ordered 1731110110 to be paid‚ the residue 01 his salary due
at Bristol (No. 819). His relations were, 11 not 01 humble
rank, quite unknown in the diocese. In 1283 he was annoyed
to find certain impostors 01 evil 101110 going about pretending
to 110 relations and getting board and lodging under the
pretence 01 being related to him (sub umbra nominis nostri).
To prevent this the archbishop ordered that nothing was to
be given to anyone who could not produce letters from him.²

The earliest mention 01 William 01 Wickwane is found in
the register 01 Richard 01 Gravesend, bishop 01 Lincoln,
under the archdeaconry 01 Buckingham‚ where are recorded
the admission and institution at Reading, on 0 kal. Feb„
