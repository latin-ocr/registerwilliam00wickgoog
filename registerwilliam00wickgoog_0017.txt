eighteen votes were given to Wickwane, and single votes
were cast by him for Master Hugh of Evesham, afterwards
cardinal of San Lorenzo in Lucina, by Master Robert of
Scarborough‚ archdeacon of the East Riding and afterwards
dean of York, for Master Thomas de Wythen, archdeacon of
York, and by Master Thomas of Hedon for Master Thomas
of Corbridge‚ a brother canon, and later on archbishop.
Ultimately Wickwane was unanimously chosen.1 On July
4 the king signified to the pope his assent to the election.2
On his arrival at Viterbo‚ whither he had gone for conse-
cration, Pope Nicholas III. referred the question of the
validity of his election to a bishop whose see has not been
identified,3 and to G.‚cardinal priest of St.Mark‚and Matthew‚
cardinal deacon of Sta Maria in Porticu. On their report
the election was quashed‚ apparently for some defect in
procedure,4 which was remedied by the pope, who himself
appointed Wickwane, so that the see should not remain
vacant longer than was absolutely necessary. The date of ⁴
the document (Ne. 740) is September 19, 1279, and stubbs,
who very possibly got his information from Wickwane’s
Register, says the archbishop was consecrated on this day.
Certain entries⁵ however in this register show that this event
must have taken place a couple of days earlier, on 15 kal.
Oct. (Sept. 17). Of his joumey across Europe there is no
record, but with his arrival in England his troubles corn-
menced. A claim had long been made by the archbishops
of York to have their cross carried before them as a mark of
their primacy, whilst travelling through the province of
Canterbury, a pretension which had always been strenuously
resisted by the southern primate. The pope, who had
foreseen this trouble, had besought John Peckham, the arch-
bishop of Canterbury, in a private letter (littera clausa), not
to enter into a contest as to the right of the archbishop of
